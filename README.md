Spaceman Word Guessing Game

Description

Spaceman is a space themed version of Hangman. Players try to guess a space themed word by selecting letters. You have 6 wrong guesses before you lose.

I chose this game because I was short on time.

Planning Materials

All done in a span of 3 days, this was the original code used https://github.com/JayYang11/spaceman-game.git


Websites Used

ChatGPT to help with code
Old lecture videos

Future upgrades I'd like to code:

Add sound effects for correct/wrong guesses
Include difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)

Add animated spaceman visual like adding body parts in hangman

There are few commits on this because I had to redo the repo, I linked the previous work I had in planning materials. Also, this project was done in the span of 2.5 days.
